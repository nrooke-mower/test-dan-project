 To complete the following work ONLY edit the html between the HEAD tags. 
 You have complete access to the internet if you need help.

 CSS:
   Create an external style sheet in the css directory.
   1) Set the background color of the div with id=red, to red.
   2) Set the text color of the element with class=blue, to blue.
   3) Set the text "Make me Bold" to bold.
   4) Remove all table and cell spacing 
   
 JS:
   Create an external javascript file in the js directory.
   Feel free to download and use any javascript library to help you complete your work.
   JQuery has been included in the js directory, as this is our library of choice.
   1) When the page loads set the even columns (in the body only) of the table to green (the columns with even numbers in them).
   2) If the "Toggle Table Stripe" button is pressed it should alternate between setting the odd/even columns to  green.
   3) Write a function that takes one parameter and returns a string of numbers from 1 to 100 separated by that parameter. (Ex: if param="," then it would return "1,2,3,5,6,7,8")
	  -For multiples of three print "Three" instead of the number.
	  -For the multiples of five print "Five" instead of the number.
	  -For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "Both".
   4) If the "Run Counter" button is pressed it should run the function you created passing in the html from div with id=runCounter_sep (get the html using JS) as the parameter.
      The button should take the returned results from the function and output them in the div with id=output. It should add the results to the beginning of the output div each time it is run with the following html added before the results:
      "<h2>Results for run #:</h2>" where # is the number of times the function has been called.
